Known bugs that need to be fixed:
- Tasks with a date do not go into the "Today" or "This week" list when they should.
- Star system, to show some tasks are more important, isn't working as intended. Tasks do not save as starred or go into the "Starred" list.
- Some buttons on the webpage need a webpage refresh to work once a task has been created.
